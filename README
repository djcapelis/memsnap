Memsnap is a basic memory snapshotting tool that takes a process and dumps its memory into flatfiles at an interval you specify.  Memsnap is able to handle multiple -p arguments and so can snapshot multiple processes at once, yielding memory snapshots from a group of processes which were all taken at similar times.

Memsnap in its own words:
$ memsnap -h
Usage: memsnap [options] -p pid
        -h Print usage
        -p <pid> Attach to <pid>
        -d <dir> Specify destination directory for snapshots
        -s <sec> Specify time interval between snapshots in seconds
        -m <ms> Specify time interval between snapshots in milliseconds
        -u <us> Specify time interval between snapshots in microseconds
        -f <snaps> Finish after taking <snaps> number of snapshots
        -g Snapshot all regions into one file globbed together
        -l Snap live, without pausing the process being snapshot
        -a Snapshot all readable regions, including read-only segs & mapped files

Limitations:
* Linux only
* Makes all kinds of horrible assumptions about the current format of /proc/<pid>/maps
* Only readable segments are pulled out of memory, segments of program memory that lack a read bit are filtered by memsnap.

Bugs:
* Some race and timing conditions are present when processes die or are killed while being snapshotted and memsnap may not behave gracefully in all cases.  (It makes attempts at being graceful normally.)
* Memsnap is not graceful when processes it is trying to snapshot and ptrace are ptrace'd by other trace utilities.

Future:
* Optionally (-c flag) produce snapshots in a coredump format for easy use with other tools
